# pooltestsim
A simple application meant to model how many tests would be used using pool testing given a population size. The simulation, given a population size, pool size stepsize, infection rate stepsize, and number of runs per simulation, computes the average number of tests used via the logic that a pool with no infections uses a single test whereas a pool with an infection uses pool size + 1 number of tests. The simulation randomly choses which pools to put the infected individuals in. Excel formated output can be seen [here](https://imgur.com/a/gdA6vhY).
