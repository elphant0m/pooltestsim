# pooltestsim
A simply application meant to model how many tests would be used given a population size. By default, population size is set at 1000 people. The simulation finds all sized pools sized pools of a population (i.e. if pop_size = 10, excluding trivial sizes 1 and 10, pool sizes include 2 and 5). The simulation, then, per each of these pool sizes, determines number of such pools and randomly selects which pools to contain an infected person (based on infection rate * pop_size). It computes the number of tests used via the logic that a pool with no infections uses a single test whereas a pool with an infection using size of pool + 1. It does this num_runs number of times and takes an average of the number of tests used per pool size and infection rate. This is what is shown [here](https://imgur.com/Jq7JjpA).
